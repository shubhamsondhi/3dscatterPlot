# 3d Scatter Plot with modified Tools

I have used the existing 3d scatter plot and added more tools. These tools provide you more flexibility. 

## Getting Started

TO deploy it, after cloneing this project just run the index.html file. Because it is based on javascript only. However some of the libraries are being called online so internet is required.

### Prerequisites

Browser must support WebGl and internet is required.
