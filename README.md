# 3dscatterPlot
I am using plot.ly to draw the 3d scatter plot and I have implemented most of the tools to modifie plotly design. 
This Scatter plot represent the farm fild type. where you can see layers based on different yield data as well as elevation of that field.
Also you can change the color and symboles too in this plotly.
