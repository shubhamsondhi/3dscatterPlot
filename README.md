# 3dscatterPlot
I am using plot.ly to draw the 3d scatter plot. but I have implemented most of the tools to update the plotly live. 
This Scatter plot represent the farm fild type. where you can see layers based on different yield data as well as elevation.
Also you can change the color and symboles too in this plotly.
